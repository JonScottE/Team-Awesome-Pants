# Method and goal

By using historical crypto, stock, and gold data, we will compare:</br>
</br>- Stocks to gold </br>- Altcoins to Bitcoin </br>- Gold to Bitcoin </br>- Altcoins to Stocks
</br></br>
Our goal is to show a correlation of the money flows from the digital market to or from traditional markets. 


# Data Sources
 
 <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance </a> For GLD & SPY </br>

 <a href="https://api.tiingo.com/">Tiingo </a> For BTC and ETH</br>
