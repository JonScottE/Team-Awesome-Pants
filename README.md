# Description

By using historical crypto, stock, and gold data, we will compare:</br>
</br>- Stocks to gold </br>- Altcoins to Bitcoin </br>- Gold to Bitcoin </br>- Altcoins to Stocks
</br></br>
Our goal is to show a correlation of the money flows from the digital market to or from traditional markets. 


# Question's

Is there a positive or negative correlation in price movement between traditional and digital markets. </br></br>
During a bull market, which of the following four asset classes acts as a leading indicator for other asset classes?</br></br>
During a bear market, which of the following asset classes acts as a leading indicator for other asset classes?
</br></br>
Subquestion: is there a strong enough correlation between the top 100 cryptos by marketcap (excluding BitCoin) and just Ethereum, where it makes sense to just use Ethereum price data.
Further analyze the correlation between ADA (crypto) and JPM (bank).
